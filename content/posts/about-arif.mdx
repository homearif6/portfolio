Born in Cilacap (1999), he graduated from the Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Design at Institut Teknologi Telkom Purwokerto (now Telkom University Purwokerto), majoring in Visual Communication Design. He currently lives and works in his hometown as a photographer and graphic designer, where his passion for creating visuals continues to grow deeper each day.

His work focuses on minimalist photography, emphasizing simplicity, clean compositions and quiet details. He captures subtle scenes with intention, allowing each element to breathe and speak. This visual approach reflects his belief that even the most ordinary moments can carry quiet depth, inviting viewers to pause, feel and interpret the stillness in their own way.
